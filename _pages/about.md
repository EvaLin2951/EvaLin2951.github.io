I’m a recent graduate from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I completed a joint major in **Computer Science** and **Statistics**. 👩🏻‍💻  
<br>
I’m passionate about designing AI systems and interfaces for everyday challenges that technology often overlooks, especially in healthcare and wellbeing. Since participating in the [AI4Good Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/) and the [RBC Borealis Let’s SOLVE it](https://rbcborealis.com/lets-solve-it/) programs, my team and I have been building **Thalia**, an AI companion for individuals going through menopause. In my previous research at McGill, I worked on models for detecting depression-related unhealthy content on social media.  
<br>
I’m convinced that the most meaningful AI happens when systems are both intuitive to use and trustworthy for the people who rely on them. I enjoy working in spaces where I can bridge research, data, and interaction design, and I’m actively seeking opportunities to deepen this work and collaborate with others who share a human-centred, ethically grounded vision of AI.

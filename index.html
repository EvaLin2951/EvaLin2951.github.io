Additionally, in the <strong>Slack CoinBot</strong> project, I utilized Python, Bolt (Slack API SDK), and MongoDB for command processing and data management. Last summer, I independently developed an <strong>e-Commerce Advertising Data Analysis Dashboard</strong>, where I conducted data analysis, and integrated technical approaches with market and product insights. <br><br> I’m passionate about using my technical skills to tackle challenging problems and improve user experiences. I’m also excited to collaborate with teams to develop innovative solutions that address real-world issues. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!</p> </body></html>
